# Truffle for developing and deploying Smart Contracts

## Ganache

Ganache is a personalised blockchain. This helps in understanding about each block creation. 
Ganache is a local development blockchain used to develop decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It simulates the Ethereum network, and you can see how your DApp will perform before you release it to production.
Typically, to start developing distributed applications on the Ethereum network, you will need to set up an Ethereum client such as Geth or OpenEthereum to provide you access to an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Although that is a great way to develop distributed applications on Ethereum, it is not the most efficient and user-friendly approach, as you need to configure these clients manually and keep them running. Maintaining a self-hosted node can be expensive and time-consuming, you donâ€™t want to spend valuable time troubleshooting a failed node during development.

With Ganache, all you need to do is start the application and you have a preconfigured Ethereum client with 10 pre-funded and unlocked accounts ready for use. This allows you to quickly test your DApp throughout your development cycle.
